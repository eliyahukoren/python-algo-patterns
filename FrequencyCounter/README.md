## Frequency Counter Pattern with Python

## What is the Frequency Counter Pattern?

It's a pattern that uses Objects, sets to inspect the frequencies of values.

You want to use this pattern when comparing inputs to multiple data, like [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram.)

It's also useful to avoid quadratic time complexity **O(nÂ²)** since the Frequency Counter Pattern has a complexity of **O(n)**.
